# Matrix
**Chrome OS tab spammer website/software. Can crash browsers and Chromebooks if Chrome setting 'allow popups' is enabled. Very funny to watch on iOS. Disguised as a game with downloadable versions available.**

You can use the website, or the downloadable files below to use this repository.
